# Restaurant-Data-Analysis-Cognifyz-Data-Science-Internship

📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes restaurant data to extract insights about customer preferences, pricing patterns, service offerings, and geographical distributions. Completed as part of the Cognifyz Data Science Internship program, this analysis demonstrates comprehensive data science skills including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
🎯 Objectives

Explore and preprocess restaurant dataset
Analyze rating distributions and identify patterns
Investigate geographical trends in restaurant locations
Examine the impact of services (table booking, online delivery) on ratings
Build predictive models for restaurant ratings
Extract actionable business insights

📊 Dataset Information
The restaurant dataset includes:

Restaurant names, locations (latitude/longitude), and addresses
Customer ratings and vote counts
Cuisine types and price ranges
Service features (table booking, online delivery availability)
City and country information

🚀 Analysis Performed
1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing

Dataset structure analysis (rows, columns, data types)
Missing value identification and handling
Data cleaning and preparation for analysis

2. Descriptive Analysis

Statistical summaries for numerical variables
Distribution analysis of categorical variables
Top cuisines and cities by restaurant count

3. Geospatial Analysis

Restaurant location mapping using latitude/longitude
Geographic distribution patterns
Location-rating correlation analysis

4. Service Features Analysis

Table booking and online delivery availability rates
Impact of services on restaurant ratings
Service availability across different price ranges

5. Price Range Analysis

Most common price ranges
Average ratings by price category
Price-quality relationship insights

6. Feature Engineering

Created binary indicators for services
Extracted text-based features (name length, address length)
Developed composite features for analysis

7. Predictive Modeling

Built regression models to predict restaurant ratings
Compared multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics

8. Customer Preference Analysis

Cuisine-rating relationships
Popular cuisines by customer votes
High-performing cuisine categories
